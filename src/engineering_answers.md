<h1>What are JavaScript Data Types?<h1>

<p>These are immutable values, plus the object type.</p>

<h1>What is the use of isNaN function?<h1>

<p>It is used to verify that parameters are non-numeric. If this parameter is non-numeric or string value NaN, the object, undefined and others returns true, otherwise it returns false.</p>

<h1>Differentiate between Real DOM and Virtual DOM<h1>

<p>DOM is the representation of the components on the page. You manipulate the DOM in order to manipulate these components (create, recreate, change their state). Virtual DOM is a framework for manipulating the DOM.</p>

<h1>How different is React’s ES6 syntax when compared to ES5?<h1>

<p>React ES6 is much more advantageous than ES5 as it considerably reduces the code bringing even better results.<p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>ES5<p>
<p>var sum = function(x, y) {<p>
    <p>return x + y;<p>
<p>};<p>
<p>ES6<p>
<p>var sum = (x,y)=>{ return x+y }</p>

<h1>What’s Typescript, why use it?<h1>

<p>The Typescript language a strong typing is a greater performance and productivity in running an application. point is the use of other objects in Javascript, which can generate doubts and confusion.</p>

<h1>What is the difference between Asynchronous and Non-blocking?<h1>

<p>Non-Blocking: It refers to the program that does not block the execution of further operations. Non-Blocking methods are executed asynchronously. Asynchronously means that the program may not necessarily execute line by line.</p>

<h1>What’s state management in React and what libraries would use for this?<h1>

<p>State management is simply a way to generate communication and data sharing between components. It creates a concrete data structure to represent the state of your application that you can read and write. Since React 16.8, every React component, whether functional or class, can have a state. Redux, ContextApi, Reducer</p>

<h1>What is Node.js? What is it used for?<h1>

<p>The Node. js is a JavaScript execution environment. With it, the user can create applications without relying on the browser for this. With high scalability, good flexibility, architecture and low cost, it becomes a great choice for programming.</p>

<br/>

<h1>What is Event-driven programming?<h1>

<p>It is a paradigm where code execution is determined by the triggering of events.</p>

<br/>

<h1>What is the difference between pull and fetch commands?<h1>

<p>Both are used to download remote content. There are important security differences between git pull and git fetch . Git fetch is the option that can be considered "safe", while git pull can be considered "unsafe". git fetch downloads the remote content and does not change the state of the local repository.</p>

<h1> What is the difference between Git and Github?<h1>

<p>Git is a local VCS software that allows developers to save snapshots of their projects over time. It is usually best for individual use. GitHub is a web-based platform that incorporates gitHub's version control features so they can be used collaboratively.</p>

<br/>

<h1> What is a branch?<h1>

<p>A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master . As you start making commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, the master branch pointer moves forward automatically.</p>

<br/>

<h1> What is a pull request?<h1>
